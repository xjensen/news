Done/doing is a recap of what we’ve done this week and what we have in our sprint plan for the week ahead. This post covers the week of December 16–22.

## Done

*   Developed MVP [design system](https://github.com/cagov/cwds/issues/17) and page templates
*   Collected 50+ responses on the [general Alpha survey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/AlphaCAgov)
*   Guest team members (shout to CHHS Office of Innovation!) tested the [State Holiday prototype](https://github.com/cagov/UX/issues) to learn how to handle 4th of July and validated that we want to keep Next Holiday feature
*   Conducted a [field research visit](https://twitter.com/CAdotGov/status/1207440359782928384) to Vital Records office in South Sacramento to test “Request a birth certificate” with guest team members from CHHS Innovation team
*   Built new Function As A Service ([FAAS](https://github.com/cagov/FunctionApps), also called “serverless”) prototype and Github integrated deployment pipeline
*   Setup [initial docs](https://github.com/cagov/cwds/issues/3) for our bootstrap based design system, rewrote first bootstrap interactive UI widget as a web component, allowing us to provide the same functionality with much smaller code footprint
*   Prototyped additional [user stories](https://github.com/cagov/UX/issues), augmented our minimum wage user prototype so it autocompletes all cities and zip codes in CA

## Doing

*   Iterate on new content type templates so we can prototype user stories faster and cleaner
*   Integrate accessibility testing tools into our code editors as automated linters, and into the CI pipeline as automated tests and into our browsers for manual testing
*   Design discussion guide for deep, qualitative research on victims of trauma and wildfire
*   Begin development on the site functionality required for Alpha site to support user story content
