And herewith, please find this week’s list of things we’ve done and what we’re doing for the week ahead. This post covers the week of May 11-May 17.

As always, this site is a work in progress, and we continue to strive to do more, and do better to help Californians.

## Done

*   Synthesized over 7600 responses via the website survey, responses have been from across all counties in CA, including all age groups (much more distributed than typical survey/website visits)

*   Integrated data dashboard and map into website
*   Our Q&A prototype that displays questions and answers relevant to internal searches graduated to user testing phase
*   Added more user behavior tracking in google analytics to identify most used sections of pages built with our web components
*   Editing and adding new content related to testing, contact tracing, Stage 2 of our roadmap, and guidance for counties and industries
*   Established initial set of changes for the homepage redesign
*   Created and published design principles and style guide for COVID19
*   Announced hiring for an [Agile Delivery Manager and Performance Analyst](https://news.alpha.ca.gov/roles/)

## Doing

*   Launching usertesting.com to get feedback on quick answers and new IA design
*   Continue to support and monitor NPI information and edit/change accordingly
*   Receiving and integrating human translated versions of all new site pages in 7 languages, continuing to refine this process
*   Improving readability on already-published content
*   Prioritizing content based on site searches and user feedback
*   Publishing homepage redesign changes for user testing

*   Continuing to work on building a recruitment pipeline of talented, committed people
