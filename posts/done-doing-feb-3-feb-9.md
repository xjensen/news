Done/doing is a recap of what we’ve done this week and what we have in our sprint plan for the week ahead.

This week’s episode is all about our second product release. We’re all hands on deck, heads down, and laser focused on getting the next round of prototypes out for your feedback. Follow our work on [GitHub Issue #303](https://github.com/cagov/Alpha/issues/303/)
