Done/doing is a recap of what we’ve done this week and what we have in our sprint plan for the week ahead. While many of us were out for the holidays, a lot of work was still getting done. This post covers the week of December 30-January 5.

*   Iterated on content types within the draft design system
*   Baselining the user needs to test for accessibility, speed, and readability

## Doing
