Done/doing is a recap of what we’ve done this week and what we have in our sprint plan for the week ahead. This post covers the week of January 20-January 26.

## Done

*   Continuing to do follow up calls with Californians around how they interact with State gov
*   Tested our CalGrants prototype with high school students and a guidance counselor
*   Talked to several Californians about their recovery process after a natural disaster
*   Researched our independent worker user story, including making a rough flow chart to try and figure out who needs to pay quarterly taxes
*   User tested and iterated on CalGrants prototype
*   Iterated on disability insurance benefits prototype
*   Conducted initial user research on a new “smart answer” content type
*   Upgraded the way we handle translation strings so we can support more languages
*   Deployed a lane closure API that remixes Caltrans data to make it geo-queryable
*   Got some good advice from [Kin Lane](http://apievangelist.com/2020/01/22/the-state-of-california-doing-apis-the-right-way-by-starting-simple/) to start each new API with public readme
*   Held Kick-off 2.0, reflected on the first ½ of Alpha, outlined goals for the next 6 weeks and got re-inspired for the second ½ of Alpha

## Doing

*   Designing and planning for a field research trip to a wildfire-impacted area
*   Doing follow-up calls with Californians around how they interact with State government and synthesizing the findings to turn into user needs
*   Prototyping quarterly taxes and phone service discounts
*   Augmenting lane closure data with seasonal road closures and chain controls for in-progress user story on road conditions
*   Augmenting food bank prototype with new data sources thanks to [@tomdooner](https://twitter.com/tomdooner), to spin up food bank API
*   Working with the great water quality advice we got from the Waterboard team, we’re going to spin up water quality APIs using available data
*   Whiteboarding with the team around content design for water quality and road conditions user stories
*   Documenting product feature ideas that we want to test and iterate on in the Alpha
