When we started working on [alpha.ca.gov](https://alpha.ca.gov) we defined our [design principles](https://news.alpha.ca.gov/alpha-ca-gov-design-principles/). They included:

* Start with user needs.
* Do less.
* Do the hard work to make it simple and elegant.
* Iterate—then iterate again.
* Make it accessible and inclusive.
* Understand context.
* Be consistent, but not uniform.

We used these principles to inform an early alpha.ca.gov style guide. As we got to work on [covid19.ca.gov](https://covid19.ca.gov/), we realized we needed to iterate on this initial guide both to meet this moment and power future projects.

Today, we’re excited to share with you our new [content style guide](https://github.com/cagov/covid19/wiki/Content-style-guide).

The new style guide iterates on [our Alpha content style guide](https://handbook.alpha.ca.gov/en/latest/content/) and pulls from two key docs: the covid19.ca.gov [crisis communication standard](https://github.com/cagov/covid19/wiki/Crisis-Standard) and our [accessibility and inclusivity guidelines](https://github.com/cagov/covid19/wiki/Inclusivity-considerations-checklist).

The new style guide provides several benefits:

* Content creators only have to look in one place when they have a question about how we do something.
* We’re more consistent in our content.
* The style guide itself models how we want to write.
* Listing our content types sparks ideas for how to present content.
* Accessibility is built into our writing from the start.
* The presence of a style guide makes us think about what more we can add.

The last point is important. The content style guide is not done. It’s a document that we continue to think about and improve on. At least once a week someone asks, “Should we add that to the style guide?” We have a dedicated Slack channel where we collaborate on additions and modifications.

In keeping with our principle of Do less, we’re hosting the style guide in our [github wiki](https://github.com/cagov/covid19/wiki). We chose this solution because formatting the content for github needed minimal work.

Much like Alpha, the content style guide is the first step in transforming the very words we use and ways we communicate with Californians. We’ve only begun our journey, but we know where we want to go and are moving there little by little.
