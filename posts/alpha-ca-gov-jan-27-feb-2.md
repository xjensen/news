Done/doing is a recap of what we’ve done this week and what we have in our sprint plan for the week ahead. This post covers the week of January 27-February 2.

## Done

*   Took a field research trip to a fire-impacted town where we brainstormed with a group of highschoolers to inspire future designs around disaster preparedness and recovery. We also met with a local elected and business owner.
*   Researched drinking water safety and the application process for unemployment insurance.
*   Met with the good folks at the Franchise Tax Board to learn about quarterly taxes and their UX practice.
*   Documented and shipped new API endpoints to retrieve food banks, CHP Incidents, Full Road closures by location. These are viewable [here.](https://api.alpha.ca.gov/)

*   Published the web components we use in our design system to npm. Check out our accordion component [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cagov/accordion).
