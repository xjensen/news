A little late is better than never. Last week’s done and this week’s doing for your perusal.

As always, this site is a work in progress, and we continue to strive to do more, and do better to help Californians.

## Done

*   Ran 14 usertesting.com interviews to provide feedback on a new site information architecture and design. Found some great, actionable insights regarding people’s preferences on the homepage. And identified important needs regarding search functionalities on the site
*   Rolled out plasma donation search powered by our public web components and APIs
*   Cut 75% off our 11ty build times by selectively running our jsdom powered post transformations based on hash comparisons and caching processed assets
*   Automated stats updates with API cronjob writing to github
*   Integrated automated image optimization into pipeline, upgraded all environments to server webp successfully
*   Designed new pages for contact tracing and plasma donation based on SME input
*   Renamed high-use buttons to have more intuitive names
*   Did readability editing on several web pages
*   Launched the first set of changes related to the redesign into production
*   Made several accessibility improvements
*   Staged second set of changes to enable user testing

## Doing

*   Reviewing our quick answer dataset generated from site crawl against the call center Q&A docs. If we can publish regular change lists automatically might be helpful
*   Continue to monitor and revamp the broad survey
*   Prototyping reorganized content based on user feedback and known audiences
*   Working on developing a global navigation for the website
*   Synthesizing and incorporating user research into redesign
